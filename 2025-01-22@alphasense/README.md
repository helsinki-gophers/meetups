### JSON issues and the future

Speaker: **Nick Kononov** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitakononov93/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Nikki1993))

Nick talked about potential problems you may run into when using JSON in Go.
The talk was filled with humor and high energy. Nick then transitioned into
what the v2 proposal of the JSON package looks like and how it solves a lot of
these problems.

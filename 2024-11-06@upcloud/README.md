## Talks

### Graceful Shutdown

Speaker: **Bengisu Kandemir** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bengisukandemir))

Bengisu talked about techniques involved in gracefully shutting down a Go
webserver, which included preventing new requests while still handling
in-flight requests. The cherry on the cake was a live demo.

### Fullstack Go

Speaker: **Valentin Ionita** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentin-ionita), [GitHub](https://github.com/vanntile), [Website](https://vanntile.com))

Valentin showed a quiz app that involved the whole stack, from a database to
HTTP web server and a frontend user interface. Building an app like this means
taking a lot of decisions and Valentin explained his thought process throughout
the talk.

from Go, several unexpected "what does this print?" questions and a few other
curve balls to make it equally challenging for the entire audience. Valentin
